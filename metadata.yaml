description: In past eras, the illegitimate children of powerful monarchs and aristocrats
  were often sent abroad to be raised where they could cause no undue embarrassment
  to their biological parents. This commonplace practice forms the plot of Rafael
  Sabatini's epic classic The Lion's Skin. In the novel, Justin Caryll, the illegitimate
  son of the influential Earl of Ostermore, travels from France to his native England
  to confront his father -- and to exact his long-planned revenge.
